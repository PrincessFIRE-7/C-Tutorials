C Programming: Lesson 1 â€“ What is C and Why Learn It?

Q1: Who created C and when?

A: C was created by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Labs.

Q2: Mention 3 real-world uses of the C language.

A:

It is used in real-world systems like operating systems (e.g., Linux).

It is fast and powerful, making it suitable for system-level and embedded programming.

It is the foundation language for many modern languages like Java, Python, and C++.

(Bonus) It is excellent for school exams and academic projects.

Q3: Why is C considered a middle-level language?

A: C is considered a middle-level language because it combines the features of low-level programming (like memory management and pointer manipulation) with high-level structures (like loops and functions). This makes it powerful yet versatile.


---

Q4: What makes C a good first language for learning programming?

A:

It is the foundation of many modern languages like Python, Java, and C++.

It teaches how computers work at a deep level (e.g., memory, logic, structure).

It helps develop logical thinking and strong fundamentals.

Bonus Q: Why is C better than Python in some areas?

A:
While Python is easier to use, C gives you manual control over memory and performance, making it faster and ideal for building operating systems, hardware-level software, and critical systems. C teaches you the core of programming while Python simplifies it.
